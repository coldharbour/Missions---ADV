Dear General Manager,My name is ________,

I was referred to you by my team leader as I would like to discuss some ethical concerns that I have about the decision to replace after-sales staff with chatbot technology.
As you know, with new technology being rapidly developed, many organisations are looking to these advancements to see if they can become more efficient and effective. There are a few things to consider when reviewing the replacement of our own staff with chatbot technology.

As one of Turners’ four key areas is optimisation across people, property, and processes, the implementation of chatbot technology would streamline customer helpline services by greatly reducing the need for a real person.

However, the reform of employee structure could trigger concerns about job loss that will disproportionately affect lower socio-economic classes. Most roles replaced by AI technology tended to be low skill/routine roles that do not require previous experience or tertiary qualifications such as customer service roles. These roles are usually filled by the lower socio-economic demographic. This is due to numerous systemic barriers that limit the opportunities for less wealthy families from higher education, connections in the business world and encourage the cycle of poverty.
    
Replacement of real humans by AI is inevitable, and that the only solution is to upskill via internships and tertiary education. These two pathways are rarely available to the impoverished population and leaves them vulnerable to unemployment with little hopes to compete with AI technology.

Through a capitalistic lens, the innate purpose of businesses is to generate wealth for the owners. However, Turner’s claims to prioritise the wellbeing of their employees. It is recommended that we implement ongoing training that can provide the skill improvement required for employees to remain unscathed by the implementation of AI technology in customer service roles.
      
Ultimately, implementing chatbots will have a long-term value to the company and for the users. Reducing the staff just by using this feature would not be empathetic, instead we could organise the MV insurance team in an efficient way to reduce the workload with the use of chatbots. MV insurance team can be divided into subcategories to handle further issue faster; General, Sales and Technical etc.
        
Always happy to hear from you.
        
Best Regards,________________
